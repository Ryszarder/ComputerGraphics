# ComputerGraphics

This was an assignment fro AIE to make our own graphics engine. The Task was rendering 3D models by importing them in and texturing them using shaders in OpenGL.

The file name Main/Graphics Engine was the final result of the project.
All projects in Graphics are either graphic engines i attempt at making but decide to restart.
